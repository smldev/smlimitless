## Technical Update #011 - Level Exits and the SMB Flagpole

### Description

#### Level Exits

A level exit is an object that, when a player activates it, completes a level. In the future, level exits will work with worlds, level packs, and episodes, but for now, a level's completion will open a file dialog to select another level to start.

#### The SMB Flagpole

The flagpole from Super Mario Bros. is a sprite that serves as a level exit. It consists of a staircase block, a flagpole atop the staircase block, and a flag attached to the top.

Players will collide with the staircase block as they would a normal tile, but if a player hits the flagpole, they will start an animation where the flag is lowered to the bottom of the pole. The higher the player hits the flagpole, the higher of a score they get.

When a player hits the flagpole, they can no longer be controlled by the user. Instead, they will walk to the right continuously. After a short delay, the exit is activated, and the file dialog opens.
