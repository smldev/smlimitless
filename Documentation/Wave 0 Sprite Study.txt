Lakitu:
	- Flies at a constant defined height
	- Accelerates instead of constant velocity
	- Tries to hover around player's horizontal position
	- Throws a sprite of a certain kind (default: Spiny in egg state) at a certain interval while there are less than a certain number of that sprite in the active area (default: 5)
	- When throwing a sprite, the sprite is given horizontal velocity equal to the Lakitu's horizontal velocity

Goal Flagpole:
	- A type of LevelExit
	- It's 11 tiles tall and 1 tile wide
	- It has a flag at the top, beneath the top ball
	- The bottom tile is a standard square tile that has default collision
	- Collisions with the bottom tile occur after normal collision routines
	- Collisions with the flagpole occur somewhat within the sprite
	- The player grabs the flagpole and lowers down it, bringing the flag with him at the same rate
	- As soon as the flag reaches the bottom, the player flips to the other side, and the standard goal-handling procedure occurs
	- The higher the player grabs the flagpole, the more points are received, divided evenly into eight portions { 100, 200, 400, 800, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000 }
	- Sprites other than the player do not activate the flagpole but do collide with it.
	- It defines a flags enum FlagpoleBarriers { None, Above, Below } that can prevent the player from going over or under the flagpole
	- This barrier extends infinitely at the center of the flagpole bar

Super Mushroom:
	- Has attribute "powerup"
	- Slides across the ground and turns on walls but not cliffs
	- When it collides with the player, the player becomes Super if the player is Small and then despawns

Fire Flower:
	- Has attribute "powerup"
	- Doesn't move
	- When it collides with the player, the player becomes Fire if the player isn't already Fire
